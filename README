Assingment 1 : C programming review

In this assignment you are to work in small teams
to produce a simple library of function that provide 
set opeatons using a linked list data structure.

You are to use the header set.h provided. If you 
want to change it, ask first.
Your library is to ba called libset.a (a static link 
library)

There will be a "more significant" test 
program than test_set.c next week.

Outcomes:
1) Review basic C programing
2) Understand the proper use of .h files
3) Understand how to build a static libtrary from .o files
4) UNderstand the difference between static and shared object libraries
5) UNderstand typedefs, structures, pointers and arrays
6) Understand passing arguements in C
7) Understwsand malloc() and free(). 
8) Understand simple Makefiles

Although you are to work on teams, every person
is expected up experiment wih the coding and fully
understand the final results. You will be aksed about
it.

I encourage you to use constructs such as:
#ifdef DEBUG
  ...
#endid
to help trace and and debug your code.
